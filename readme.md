## Authentication-System

A Laravel-Boilerplate for the Technopathic Full-Stack Web Development series was used in the creation of this site.

This API-Routes was created to learn to create routes to the database.

## Getting Started
To reuse this code as a framework, fork this repo and clone it onto your local computer. Then run `composer install` to install all of the necessary libraries.
```
git clone https://github.com/CJacobson1986/Authentication-System.git
cd API-Routes
composer install
```

From there you should go ahead and generate a Controller `php artisan make:controller API-Routes`. Next, you should change the .env.example file name to .env.

To start the server, simply do `php artisan serve`.


## Commands
To generate Controllers:
`php artisan make:controller ControllerName`

To migrate:
`php artisan migrate`
